This readme file contains the details of the project as well as the instructions on how to run the game.

This project contains the files that will run the classic game of 2D Pong. Pong is a multiplayer game where a player controls a paddle that is capable of hitting a ball air-hockey style. A player scores when the ball hits the enemy's goal line. Our team has modified the traditional game to add additional rules for more fun! As general instructions:

Paddles: Use either the WS or "UP"/"DOWN" keys to move the paddles
When a point is scored: Press 'P' to restart the game
Press 'X' at any time to quit the entire game

The modes and their respective rules are as follows:

Infinite - Base game that never ends regardless of score. Ball color changes for christmas festivity!
Best of 10 - Similar to the infinite mode but once a player scores 10 points, that player wins
Speed Stack - Every time the ball hits a paddle, it speeds up by a certain amount until a player loses a point. Zoom!
